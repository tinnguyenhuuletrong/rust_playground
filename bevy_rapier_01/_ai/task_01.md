Target: 
- Trying to make a determinism physic simulation by using bevy + rapier2d
- It should output same simulation state on web and desktop 

Document: 
- https://docs.rs/bevy_rapier2d/latest/bevy_rapier2d/


Problem:
- When press R to restart -> it different for each time 

Note 
    - Seem it determinism for 1st run (without R to restart). start -> all entities sleep 

Task 
- Analyze the problem. try to explain why
